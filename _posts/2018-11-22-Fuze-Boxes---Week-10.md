  <tr>
    <td>Persevering</td>
    <td>Going further into the booklet the assessments become harder, we tried so hard to not let that stop us and we completed a lot in a short period of time.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Questioning?</td>
    <td>We had constantly checking the code for mistakes and questioning the logic behind why the code would work.</td>

    <td>Independence</td>
    <td></td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Reflecting</td>
    <td>As like in many other scenarios, we had to reflect on the knowledge that we have already gained by Fuze and apply that of the small assessments at the end of every chapter.</td>

    <td>We could have finished more or at least gone through the next couple of chapters so that next week we are prepared.</td>

    <td>What changes do you need to make to improve your learning next time?</td>
    <td></td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>I need to read a few chapters in advance and check over them a lot so that I remember them and then the assessments would be easier, I would feel more prepared and due to this I have a high likelihood of getting great marks.</td>
