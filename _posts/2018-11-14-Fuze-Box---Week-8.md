    <td>Starting point:</td>
    <td>We've been introduced to the Robot Arms on the Fuze Boxes.</td>

    <td>Target for this lesson?</td>
    <td>Try to make the Robot Arms remote controlled, and get as far through the booklet as possible.</td>

    <td>Did I reach my target? </td>
    <td>No, but making the Robot Arm remote controlled was the next step.</td>

    <td>Persevering</td>

  <tr>
    <td>Independence</td>
    <td>There was independence, to an extent, (of course) because we were in partners, therefore it was more about teamwork and listening to the other person’s thoughts and inputs.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Reflecting</td>
    <td>We had learnt a small amount on Robot Arms before so I tried to go back to that and remember the problems I encountered then and tried not to encounter them again.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Engagement</td>
    <td>We were very engaged and tried so hard to get to the final task, yet we were just one task from starting it.</td>

  <tr>
    <td>What could have gone better in your learning?</td>
    <td></td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>I could've understood the code behind what makes the Robot Arm remote controlled (which I didn’t know during the first few minutes in the lesson, but knew as we progressed because the booklet was very helpful and explained everything in simple terms, so that I could understand it).</td>

    <td>What changes do you need to make to improve your learning next time?</td>
    <td></td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>I need to go to the booklet more because it literally tells you what to do and explains it after.</td>
