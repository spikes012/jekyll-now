    <td>Did I reach my target? </td>
    <td>Yes, we completed the assessments for stage one. But have yet to complete the assessments for 2,3 and 4.</td>

  <tr>
    <td>We could have paid attention more, and we should have read the booklet over when we had finished a stage o it. Therefore, we would have been more engaged and active and many things would have come to memory.</td>

    <td>What changes do you need to make to improve your learning next time?</td>
