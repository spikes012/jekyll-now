    <td>Starting point:</td>
    <td>We have done as many assessments as we can.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Target for this lesson?</td>
    <td>Enjoy making characters/animations from binary, in Python.</td>

  <tr>
    <td>Did I reach my target? </td>
    <td>Yes, my partner and I had lots of fun making our small snowman animation.</td>

  <tr>
    <td>Persevering</td>
    <td>We tried hard to make our animation cool, but simple as we had a small workspace (10 by 4).</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Questioning?</td>
    <td>We questioned what we had learnt as we wanted the character to be animated in different places and wanted it to repeat, however this didn't work even when we put repeat there, too.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Independence</td>
    <td>We did ask for the teachers help, but we made the snowman from scratch by planning it on paper and finding the sums of each line.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Reflecting</td>
    <td>We reflected on what we have learnt from the past doing "DEFCHAR" with Python.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Engagement</td>
    <td>We were struggling on how to make the character bigger or smaller, so our teacher helped us.</td>
  </tr>

    <td>What could have gone better in your learning?</td>

  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>We struggled on a part of the DEFCHAR animations as we wanted the snowman to unbutton and button his snow shirt over and over again, but in different places, however this didn't work even when we put repeat in. I think it has to do with the character not being in the same coordinates as it moved around, and that’s why it didn’t repeat. Therefore, what could’ve gone better in my learning is me reading the booklet and checking for these things in advance so that we don’t get hung up on these small problems when doing binary animation with Python.</td>

    <td>What changes do you need to make to improve your learning next time?</td>

  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>I need to read the booklet, as it tells us these problems in advance, so if we had read it then we would have been able to do progressingly hard stuff, instead of wasting time on a snowman animation.</td>
