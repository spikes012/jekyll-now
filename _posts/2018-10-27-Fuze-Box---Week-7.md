  <tr>
    <td>Starting point:</td>
    <td>We have learnt a lot about how to "Print", change the colour of the background, using time when doing text  and how to create characters.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Target for this lesson?</td>
    <td>To understand and put into practice how to code “Robot Arms”.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Did I reach my target? </td>
    <td>Yes, we used and coded “Robot Arms”.</td>
  </tr>

  <tr>
    <td>How did you use your learning habits this week?</td>
    <td></td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Persevering</td>
    <td>First, we didn't understand which parts of the "Robot Arm" was which and we got confused, but we used trial and error to find out what each part can do.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Questioning?</td>
    <td></td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Independence</td>
    <td>We didn’t take the teachers help but checked everything with the booklet of instructions.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Reflecting</td>
    <td>We used our knowledge that every part of the arm needs to be coded even though it is doing nothing.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Engagement</td>
    <td>We worked hard and got on with our work,, sometimes asking questions about what each part does when coded with specific numbers e.g. “Armlight (1)” this means the light on the arm will be switched on when this code is inputted.</td>
  </tr>

  <tr>
    <td>What could have gone better in your learning?</td>
    <td></td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>We could have tried to find the answers by ourselves because this would've made us think more for ourselves.</td>
    <td></td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>What changes do you need to make to improve your learning next time?</td>
    <td></td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>I need to try everything by myself, and, only in the utmost need, call the teacher and ask them.</td>
